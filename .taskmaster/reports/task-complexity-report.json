		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Foundation and Directory Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project foundation setup into specific directory creation, TypeScript configuration, module resolution setup, and initial file scaffolding tasks.",
			"reasoning": "Involves multiple file system operations and configuration setup, but follows standard patterns. Requires TypeScript path configuration and isolation setup which adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Define TypeScript Types and Interfaces",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create separate subtasks for core upload types, validation interfaces, component prop types, and advanced TypeScript 5.x features implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to comprehensive type system design, generic types, and modern TypeScript features. Requires careful interface design and JSDoc documentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Utility Functions",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into image validation logic, file processing utilities, compression algorithms, error handling implementation, performance optimization, and constants configuration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to image processing, Canvas API usage, multiple validation rules, and performance considerations. Requires handling various file formats and edge cases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Custom React Hooks",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into useAngleUpload implementation, useImageProcessing hook, state management with useReducer, memory management and cleanup, and React 18 concurrent features integration.",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to advanced React patterns, memory management, concurrent rendering compatibility, and complex state transitions. Requires deep React knowledge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build PhotoFrame Component",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into component structure and accessibility, state management and animations, touch interactions, responsive design and aspect ratio handling, styling integration, and comprehensive testing setup.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple states, animations, accessibility requirements, touch interactions, and responsive design. Requires integration of multiple technologies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Upload and Next Button Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create UploadButton component, NextButton component, brutalist styling implementation, and state synchronization with parent components.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving button state management, design system implementation, and parent-child component communication. Straightforward but requires attention to detail."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create CSS Modules and Styling System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Design system foundation, mobile-first responsive layouts, brutalist styling implementation, animations and transitions, and accessibility styling features.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive design system, responsive design requirements, performance-optimized animations, and accessibility considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Main Container Component",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Container component architecture, state orchestration and event handling, error boundary implementation, workflow integration, performance optimization, and comprehensive error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as it integrates all previous components, manages complex state flows, requires error boundaries, and orchestrates the entire upload workflow."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate with Next.js Routing and Mobile Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Next.js route setup and configuration, mobile navigation integration, SEO and meta tags implementation, performance optimization, and route guards and navigation flow.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to Next.js integration patterns, mobile navigation requirements, SEO considerations, and ensuring proper route-level error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Unit testing suite implementation, integration and E2E testing, accessibility testing and auditing, performance benchmarking, visual regression testing, cross-browser compatibility, and code coverage optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to comprehensive testing requirements across multiple dimensions - unit, integration, accessibility, performance, and visual regression testing."
