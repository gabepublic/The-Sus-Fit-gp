		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Try It On Component Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1) Create TryItOnContainer.tsx with state management integration, 2) Create TryItOn.tsx presentation component, 3) Create TryItOnWithErrorBoundary.tsx wrapper, 4) Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in types/index.ts, 5) Set up barrel exports in index.ts, 6) Create basic unit tests for component rendering",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily scaffolding work following well-established patterns from UploadAngle and UploadFit components. The existing mobile architecture provides clear templates to follow, making this straightforward structural work with moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ActionButton Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create ActionButton.tsx extending existing Button system, 2) Define ActionButton.types.ts with variant interfaces, 3) Implement 'tryon' and 'share' variants with brutalist styling, 4) Add accessibility features and ARIA support, 5) Implement loading states and animations, 6) Add touch interaction handling, 7) Create comprehensive unit tests including accessibility testing",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to need to extend existing Button system while maintaining design consistency. The existing Button.tsx provides good foundation, but requires careful integration with mobile touch patterns and accessibility requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate PhotoFrame with Try It On Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Add TRY_IT_ON_CONFIG to photoframe.config.ts with mannequin image and 3:4 aspect ratio, 2) Update PHOTOFRAME_VIEW_CONFIGS to include 'tryon' type, 3) Update PhotoFrameViewType union type, 4) Create tests for new configuration validation",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity since PhotoFrame configuration system is already well-established. The existing config structure in photoframe.config.ts provides clear patterns. Mainly involves adding a new configuration entry and updating types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Mock Try It On Workflow Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create useTryItOnLogic.tsx hook with TryItOnState interface, 2) Implement mock data with picsum placeholder, 3) Create wrapper around useTryonWorkflow, 4) Implement state management for all workflow states, 5) Add button state logic (Try It On -> hide -> Share), 6) Implement loading states with progress tracking, 7) Add error handling and retry logic, 8) Create comprehensive tests for all state transitions",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to complex state management integration with existing useTryonWorkflow. Requires careful state orchestration and mock implementation while maintaining interface compatibility for future real API integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Image Transformation Animation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create Framer Motion animation variants for fade-in effect, 2) Implement top-to-bottom transition using CSS mask/clip-path, 3) Add image preloading for smooth transitions, 4) Implement hardware acceleration optimizations, 5) Add reduced-motion accessibility support, 6) Create performance tests and cross-device validation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving sophisticated animations and performance optimization. The codebase already uses Framer Motion extensively, but this requires advanced animation techniques with performance considerations for mobile devices."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Try It On Core Component Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Integrate PhotoFrame with 'tryon' configuration, 2) Implement conditional ActionButton rendering logic, 3) Connect useTryItOnLogic hook for state management, 4) Implement image transformation sequence, 5) Add loading state UI with progress indicator, 6) Handle error states with retry functionality, 7) Implement navigation to Share View, 8) Add ARIA live regions for accessibility, 9) Create integration tests for complete user flow",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as this is the main integration component requiring coordination of PhotoFrame, ActionButton, state management, animations, and navigation. Critical component that ties together all previous tasks with complex user interaction flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Navigation and Route Integration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Update /m/tryon/page.tsx to use TryItOnWithErrorBoundary, 2) Implement navigation to /m/share using Next.js useRouter, 3) Add route prefetching and error boundaries, 4) Implement proper meta tags and SEO, 5) Create E2E navigation tests with Playwright",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving Next.js App Router integration. The existing mobile routing patterns provide good foundation, but requires careful integration with error boundaries and mobile-specific routing patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create unit tests for all components in __tests__ directory, 2) Implement React Testing Library tests for TryItOnContainer and TryItOn, 3) Create hook tests for useTryItOnLogic, 4) Implement accessibility tests using jest-axe, 5) Create Playwright visual regression tests, 6) Add mobile interaction tests for touch events, 7) Test error scenarios and retry functionality, 8) Create performance tests for animations, 9) Implement MSW mock service worker tests, 10) Validate 90%+ coverage with comprehensive edge cases",
			"reasoning": "High complexity requiring comprehensive testing across unit, integration, accessibility, visual regression, and E2E levels. The existing Jest and Playwright infrastructure provides foundation, but this requires extensive test creation to meet 90%+ coverage requirement and quality standards."
