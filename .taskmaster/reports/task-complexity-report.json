			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Data Models and TypeScript Interfaces",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of comprehensive TypeScript interfaces into logical groups: core social platform types, image customization interfaces, validation schemas, and integration with existing codebase patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to need for comprehensive type definitions, Zod schema integration, and alignment with existing codebase. Requires understanding of multiple platform requirements and strict TypeScript configuration."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Social Sharing Core Hook",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into mutation setup, share validation logic, retry mechanism with exponential backoff, share history management, and optimistic updates with cache invalidation.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to multiple concerns: mutations, retry logic, history management, and cache coordination. Requires careful state management and error recovery patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Image Customization Management Hook",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into Canvas API integration setup, text overlay system, sticker placement logic, filter application system, undo/redo stack implementation, and image export with optimization.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to Canvas API manipulation, complex state management with undo/redo, and multiple image editing features. Requires performance optimization and immutable state patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Social Platform Button Component",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into component structure and styling, accessibility implementation, and loading/disabled state management with platform branding.",
			"reasoning": "Standard UI component complexity. Well-established patterns for button components with states, but needs platform-specific customization and accessibility compliance."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Social Sharing Tray Component",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into platform availability integration, responsive layout implementation, animation system, and integration with existing notification system.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring integration of multiple hooks, responsive design, animations, and coordination with existing systems. UI complexity with state management concerns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Share Customization Modal",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into modal structure and behavior, Canvas preview implementation, text overlay editor, sticker library with drag-and-drop, platform format optimization, undo/redo UI controls, and export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity combining modal management, real-time Canvas operations, drag-and-drop interactions, and multiple editing features. Requires sophisticated state management and performance optimization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Instagram Stories API Integration",

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Additional Platform APIs",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create separate implementation subtasks for each platform: TikTok Creator API integration, Twitter API v2 implementation, Facebook Graph API integration, Snapchat Kit implementation, plus cross-platform error handling, rate limiting coordination, and environment configuration.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to multiple distinct API integrations, each with unique requirements, authentication methods, and format specifications. Requires extensive external API knowledge and coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Build Image Processing API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into Sharp.js setup and basic processing, text overlay rendering, sticker composition system, platform-specific optimization, and memory management with cleanup.",
