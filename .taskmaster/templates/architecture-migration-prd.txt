# Three-Layer Architecture Migration PRD

## Executive Summary

Migrate the existing try-on application from direct API calls in page components to a three-layer architecture with smart React Query business hooks, bridge layer custom hooks, and feature flag configuration system. This migration maintains all current functionality while establishing a scalable foundation for multi-client customization.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **Page Component**: Direct fetch calls to `/api/tryon` with complex state management
- **API Layer**: Working Next.js route at `src/app/api/tryon/route.ts`
- **Lib Layer**: Functional `openaiClient.ts` with try-on generation logic
- **Hooks**: Minimal structure with only `useToast` re-export

### Current Workflow
```
page.tsx → fetch('/api/tryon') → route.ts → openaiClient.ts → OpenAI API
```

### Pain Points
- Business logic mixed with UI logic in page component
- Hard to test business logic independently
- Difficult to reuse logic across different UIs
- No caching or retry mechanisms
- Manual error handling and loading states

## Target Architecture

### New Workflow
```
page.tsx → useTryonWorkflow() → useTryonMutation() → /api/tryon → openaiClient.ts
```

### Layer Responsibilities
- **Presentation**: Pure UI components, event handling
- **Bridge Layer**: UI-friendly custom hooks, state coordination
- **Business Layer**: Smart React Query hooks with business logic
- **Data Layer**: API routes and external service integration

## Migration Requirements

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create business layer directory structure
- Setup React Query provider configuration
- Establish feature flag system
- Create core TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Business Logic Migration
- Migrate try-on functionality to React Query mutation
- Move image processing logic to business layer
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Add caching strategies for generated images

### Phase 3: Bridge Layer Implementation
- Create UI-friendly custom hooks
- Migrate page component state management
- Establish clean component interfaces
- Maintain existing UI behavior

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Connect all layers together
- Ensure existing functionality works unchanged
- Add testing framework for layered architecture
- Document migration patterns for future features

### Business Layer Components

#### Core Provider Setup
- React Query client configuration with sensible defaults
- Feature flag provider for client customization
- Error boundary integration for business logic failures

#### Try-on Mutation Hook
- Migrate existing try-on logic from page component
- Implement React Query useMutation with proper typing
- Add image processing pipeline (resize, compression, validation)
- Include retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Image Processing Query
- File validation and metadata extraction
- Preview generation for UI display
- Processing status and optimization suggestions

### Bridge Layer Hooks

#### Try-on Workflow Hook
- Coordinate try-on generation process
- Manage UI-specific state (polaroid display, generated images)
- Provide clean interface for page component
- Handle success/error state transitions

#### Image Upload Hooks
- File upload handling with validation
- Preview URL management
- Upload progress and status tracking

### Feature Flag System

#### Client Configuration
- Support for different feature sets per client
- Runtime feature toggle capabilities
- Environment-based configuration loading

#### Feature Integration
- Conditional business logic based on enabled features
- UI component feature gating
- Graceful degradation for disabled features

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- All existing try-on functionality works identically
- No regression in user experience or performance
- Existing API routes and lib functions unchanged
- Current UI components work without modification

### Architectural Requirements
- Clear separation between presentation, business, and data layers
- Business logic testable independently from UI
- Bridge hooks provide clean, reusable interfaces
- Feature flag system enables client customization

### Quality Requirements
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states and retry mechanisms for network failures
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout all layers
- Caching strategies to improve performance

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Approach
1. Build new architecture alongside existing code
2. Gradually migrate functionality without breaking changes
3. Keep existing page.tsx working during migration
4. Switch to new hooks once fully implemented and tested

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain existing functionality during migration
- Create feature flags to enable/disable new architecture
- Comprehensive testing at each migration step
- Rollback plan if issues arise

## Testing Strategy

### Business Layer Testing
- Unit tests for React Query hooks behavior
- Business logic validation testing
- Error handling and retry mechanism testing
- Cache behavior and invalidation testing

### Bridge Layer Testing
- Integration tests for hook coordination
- UI state management testing
- Component interface compatibility testing

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete workflow testing from UI to API
- Feature flag behavior validation
- Performance regression testing

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Preparation
- Architecture supports multiple client UIs
- Feature flag system enables per-client customization
- Business logic reusable across different platforms
- Clear patterns for adding new features

### Development Workflow
- Independent team development on different layers
- Clear interfaces between layers reduce conflicts
- Testing strategy supports confident refactoring
- Documentation patterns for future feature development

## Deliverables

### Core Infrastructure
- Business layer directory structure and providers
- Feature flag configuration system
- TypeScript type definitions for all layers
