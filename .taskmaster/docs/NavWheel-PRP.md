NavWheel-PRP.md


ok now we need to work on a PRP document to describe and facilitate the development of
  the Navigation Wheel component. The PRP document will be processed by Task Master AI in
  order to produce tasks to help guide the development. The navigation wheel will be at
  the bottom of each of the views, and have a overall position state of lowered or raised
  state. In the Home View, the position state will be lowered. It will have a hamburger
  menu style button on it at the top that allows the user to activate it, which will cause
  it to slide up further into view
