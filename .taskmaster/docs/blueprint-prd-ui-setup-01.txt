# Overview 
We are starting with a blank-canvas, web-based application that will evolve incrementally into a full-featured product usable on both desktop and mobile platforms.

# Core Features  
1. **Responsive Web Application**
   - **Purpose**: Enables access via any modern browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
   - **Value**: Maximizes accessibility and usabilityâ€”no installation required.
   - **Implementation**: Uses responsive web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript frameworks) to adapt layout dynamically across screen sizes.

2. **Minimal Single-Page Experience**
   - **Purpose**: Centralizes user interactions in a single page.
   - **Value**: Reduces friction and improves UI performance.
   - **Implementation**: Single HTML shell with dynamic content and routing managed by client-side logic (i.e., Next.js).

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**: Will be defined incrementally alongside feature development.

- **Key User Flows**: Introduced progressively with each new feature.

- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - Clean, intuitive design
  - Mobile-first layout with generously sized buttons and controls optimized for finger input.
  - Lightweight and performance-optimized

# Development
- Git repository is ready, the branch has been created and it's the current branch. 
- Implement Responsive Single Page Application (SPA) UI shell using Next.js single-page architecture 
  - The SPA scaffold has been created using `npx create-next-app@latest`
	- ESLint is installed for code linting; already installed with Next.js scaffolding.
	- Tailwind CSS is already installed with Next.js scaffolding.
	- App Router structure is adopted
    - Review the `package.json` file for installed modules and versions
  - The `app/layout.tsx` and `app.page.tsx` have been pruned to meet the blank-canvas 
  - Review the structure, routing, and folder conventions
- Complete the blank-canvas, web-based application that will evolve incrementally into a full-featured product usable on both desktop and mobile platforms
    - Blank Canvas Enforcement: during module installation & setup (e.g. TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide, fonts), temporary UI elements or test components (e.g. buttons, sample cards, headers) may be added to layout.tsx, page.tsx, or any other visual entry point for verification.
      - MANDATORY: All such temporary UI elements and components must be removed immediately after successful verification to restore the application to a blank canvas state.
