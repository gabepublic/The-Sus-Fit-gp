# Mobile Upload Your Angle View - Visual Fidelity Improvements

## Problem Statement

The current mobile Upload Your Angle View implementation has significant visual fidelity gaps compared to the reference design located at `docs/assets/mobile/reference-images/UploadYourAngleViewBefore.png`. While the functionality is sound with good mobile usability patterns and touch targets, the current design lacks the vibrant, energetic aesthetic required to match the intended brand experience.

## Goals

1. Achieve visual fidelity to the reference design while maintaining existing functionality
2. Preserve mobile usability patterns and responsive behavior
3. Implement the vibrant, energetic brand aesthetic shown in the reference
4. Maintain appropriate touch targets and mobile interaction patterns

## Requirements

### Visual Design Requirements
- Match color palette and visual energy from reference design
- Implement proper typography hierarchy as shown in reference
- Align component positioning and spacing with reference layout
- Apply brand-appropriate visual styling and effects
- Ensure visual consistency with overall app design system

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain existing mobile functionality and responsive behavior
- Preserve current touch target sizes and interaction patterns
- Ensure cross-device compatibility and performance
- Follow existing code conventions and component patterns
- Implement changes using current tech stack (React/Next.js)

### Quality Assurance Requirements
- Visual comparison testing against reference design
- Mobile device testing across different screen sizes
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Accessibility compliance maintenance

## Success Criteria

- Visual implementation matches reference design with 95%+ fidelity
- All existing mobile functionality remains intact
- Performance metrics remain within acceptable ranges
- Mobile usability patterns continue to work effectively
- Brand aesthetic is properly expressed through visual design

## Technical Context

- Current implementation is functionally sound
- Mobile usability patterns work well with appropriate touch targets
- Responsive behavior is working correctly
- Need substantial visual design updates to match intended brand experience
- Focus on visual styling rather than functional changes
