- Implement Responsive Single Page Application (SPA) UI shell using Next.js single-page architecture 
  - The SPA scaffold has been created using `npx create-next-app@latest`
	- ESLint is installed for code linting; already installed with Next.js scaffolding.
	- Tailwind CSS is already installed with Next.js scaffolding.
	- App Router structure is adopted
    - Review the `package.json` file for installed modules and versions
  - The `app/layout.tsx` and `app.page.tsx` have been pruned to meet the blank-canvas 
  - Review the structure, routing, and folder conventions
- Complete the blank-canvas, web-based application that will evolve incrementally into a full-featured product usable on both desktop and mobile platforms
    - Blank Canvas Enforcement: during module installation & setup (e.g. TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide, fonts), temporary UI elements or test components (e.g. buttons, sample cards, headers) may be added to layout.tsx, page.tsx, or any other visual entry point for verification.
      - MANDATORY: All such temporary UI elements and components must be removed immediately after successful verification to restore the application to a blank canvas state.
