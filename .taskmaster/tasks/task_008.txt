# Task ID: 8
# Title: Establish Minimal SPA Routing & Page Placeholder
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up single-page navigation model with client-side transitions.
# Details:
• Keep single route (`/`) but implement client sections via hash or dynamic tabs
• Alternatively, create shallow routes (`/section/[id]`) using Next.js `useRouter().push()`
• Add fallback 404 page
• Prefetch links for perceived performance

# Test Strategy:
• Navigate between sections – network tab shows no full page reloads
• Lighthouse Performance Time to Interactive < 1.5 s on mobile emulation
