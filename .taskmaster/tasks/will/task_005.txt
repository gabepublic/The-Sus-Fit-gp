# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Bridge Layer Custom Hooks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create UI-friendly custom hooks that coordinate business logic and manage component state
# Details:
Create useTryonWorkflow hook in src/hooks/ that coordinates the complete try-on generation process. Implement useImageUpload hooks for file upload handling with validation and preview URL management. Create clean interfaces that abstract business logic complexity from UI components. Maintain backward compatibility with existing page component state structure (isCapturing, showPolaroid, generatedImage, hasError).

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for hook coordination, UI state management tests, component interface compatibility validation
