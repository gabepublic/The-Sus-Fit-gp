# Task ID: 7
# Title: Migrate Page Component to Use New Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor src/app/page.tsx to use bridge layer hooks while preserving exact UI behavior and functionality
# Details:
Replace direct API calls and complex state management in page component with bridge layer hooks. Update handleCameraButtonClick to use useTryonWorkflow hook. Replace file upload handlers with useImageUpload hooks. Maintain exact same UI behavior, loading states, error handling, and user experience. Remove redundant state management code while preserving all existing functionality.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end tests for complete user workflow, UI behavior regression tests, performance comparison with original implementation
