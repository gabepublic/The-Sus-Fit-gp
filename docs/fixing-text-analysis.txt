  Error Categories (by Impact & Complexity)

  üî¥ Critical Issues (High Impact, Blocks Test Execution)

  1. Mock Variable Hoisting Errors
  - Files: imageProcessing.test.ts, mutation.integration.test.ts
  - Error: ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mockXXX' before initialization
  - Impact: Prevents entire test suites from running
  - Cause: Jest mocks referencing variables before they're declared

  2. Import Path Resolution Failures
  - Files: Bridge-layer tests (useTryonWorkflow.test.tsx, etc.)
  - Error: Cannot resolve @test/index and @/hooks imports
  - Impact: 3+ test suites completely blocked
  - Cause: Missing or circular dependencies in test-utils

  üü° Major Issues (Medium-High Impact)

  3. React Testing Library Assertion Failures
  - Files: useTryonMutation.test.tsx, component tests
  - Error: "Expected element to have text content" / "Unable to find element"
  - Impact: ~40+ individual test failures
  - Cause: Component rendering issues, incorrect selectors

  4. API Mock Response Structure Mismatches
  - Files: Mutation tests, component integration tests
  - Error: Expected vs Received object structure differences
  - Impact: ~30+ test failures
  - Cause: Mock responses don't match actual API contracts

  üü¢ Minor Issues (Low-Medium Impact)

  5. React Context Provider Issues
  - Files: FeatureFlagProvider.test.tsx, useFeatureFlag.test.tsx
  - Error: Context must be used within provider
  - Impact: ~10+ tests
  - Cause: Missing provider wrappers in tests

  6. Configuration/Type Expectation Mismatches
  - Files: featureFlags.config.test.ts
  - Error: Boolean/config value mismatches
  - Impact: ~5+ tests
  - Cause: Default values changed

  Strategic Fix Plan (Ordered by ROI)

  Phase 1: Quick Wins (Highest ROI)

  1. Fix Mock Hoisting Issues ‚ö°
    - Move mock variables inside jest.mock() calls
    - Impact: Unlocks 2-3 test suites immediately
    - Effort: 30 minutes
  2. Fix Test-Utils Import Issues ‚ö°
    - Verify/implement missing exports in bridge-layer-test-utils.tsx
    - Impact: Unlocks 3+ bridge-layer test suites
    - Effort: 1-2 hours

  Phase 2: High-Impact Fixes

  3. Standardize API Mock Responses
    - Align mock objects with expected API contract
    - Impact: Fixes 30+ mutation/API tests
    - Effort: 2-3 hours
  4. Fix Component Rendering Issues
    - Update selectors and component assertions
    - Impact: Fixes 40+ component tests
    - Effort: 4-6 hours

  Phase 3: Cleanup

  5. Provider Context Fixes
    - Add missing provider wrappers
    - Impact: Fixes 10+ context tests
    - Effort: 1-2 hours
  6. Configuration Alignment
    - Update test expectations to match configs
    - Impact: Fixes 5+ config tests
    - Effort: 30 minutes

  Recommended Approach

  Start with Phase 1 - These fixes will likely reduce your failing tests from 109 to ~60-70 with minimal effort, giving you immediate momentum and unblocking
  entire test suites.

  The mock hoisting and import issues are preventing whole test files from running, so fixing those first will give you the biggest impact for the least effort.

**PROMPTS I USED**

***Phase 1: Root Cause Analysis (DO THIS FIRST)

Claude Code, I need you to analyze test failures BEFORE making any changes.

Read the test-failures.log file and categorize ALL failures into these specific groups:

1. **IMPORT/EXPORT ERRORS**: Functions that are "not a function" or module resolution errors
2. **MOCK SETUP ISSUES**: Problems with jest mocks or test setup
3. **TEST ASSERTION FAILURES**: Tests that run but assertions fail
4. **COMPONENT RENDERING ISSUES**: React component test failures

For each category:
- Count the exact number of failures
- Identify which specific functions/modules are missing or broken
- Determine dependency relationships (which failures will cascade-fix others)

CRITICAL: Do NOT make any code changes yet. Only analyze and report back with:
- Total count per category
- The specific missing functions/exports that are causing cascade failures
- Which category should be fixed FIRST to resolve the most failures

Stop after analysis. Wait for my confirmation before proceeding.
