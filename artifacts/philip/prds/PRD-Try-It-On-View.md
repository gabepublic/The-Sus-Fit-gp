# Try It On View - Mobile Component Implementation

## Project Overview

The Try It On View is a mobile component that allows users to visualize how selected garments will look on their uploaded photo through AI-powered virtual try-on technology. This component represents the core functionality of the mobile application where users can see the transformation results and proceed to share their generated images.

## Component Architecture

### Primary Component Structure
- **TryItOnContainer**: Main container component managing state and workflow
- **TryItOn**: Core view component rendering the UI
- **Shared Components**: PhotoFrame, ActionButton (new), ErrorBoundary
- **Integration**: useTryonWorkflow hook, navigation, shared mobile patterns

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Initial State Display
- Display the PhotoFrame component with the mannequin placeholder image (`public/images/mobile/mannequin.png`)
- Overlay a "Try It On" button in the same position as the "Upload Your Fit" button in Upload Angle View
- Button should use the shared brutalist design system (pink #ff69b4, black borders, blue shadows)
- PhotoFrame should be configured for "tryon" view type

#### 2. Try It On Button Interaction
- Button triggers the useTryonWorkflow hook when clicked
- Initially use mock/fake data for the workflow to avoid API costs
- Button disappears immediately after click to prevent spam clicking
- Loading state should be displayed during processing

#### 3. Image Transformation Effect
- Create a fade-in effect that transforms the mannequin into the generated result
- Effect should animate from top to bottom, creating a "transforming" visual
- Original mannequin image fades out as new image fades in
- Smooth transition duration should be 800-1200ms

#### 4. Share Button Appearance
- After transformation completes, display a "Share" button
- Button appears at the same Y position as the original "Try It On" button
- Uses the same brutalist design system as other mobile buttons
- Navigates to the Share View (/m/share) when clicked

#### 5. State Management
- Track current view state: initial, processing, transformed, error
- Manage generated image URL from useTryonWorkflow
- Handle loading states and error conditions
- Maintain accessibility announcements for state changes

### Technical Requirements

#### 1. Component Integration
- Use existing shared PhotoFrame component
- Leverage shared Button/ActionButton component architecture
- Follow established mobile component patterns
- Integrate with mobile routing system

#### 2. Hook Integration
- Use existing useTryonWorkflow hook from src/hooks/useTryonWorkflow.ts
- Initially mock the hook responses with fake image data
- Structure for easy transition to real API calls later
- Handle workflow states properly (idle, processing, complete, error)

#### 3. Mock Data Implementation
```typescript
const mockTryonData = {
  generatedImageUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/400/600?random=1',
  processingTime: 2000, // 2 second mock delay
  success: true
};
```

#### 4. Animation Implementation
- Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Implement CSS transforms for the fade-in effect
- Ensure animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Optimize for mobile performance

## Design Requirements

### Visual Design
- Follow the existing mobile design system
- Use brutalist pink/black/blue color scheme
- Maintain consistency with Upload Angle and Upload Fit views
- Ensure proper touch targets (44px minimum)

### Layout
- PhotoFrame positioned centrally with proper mobile margins
- Buttons positioned at bottom of PhotoFrame area
- Responsive design that works on various mobile screen sizes
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management during state transitions

## User Experience Requirements

### Interaction Flow
1. User sees mannequin image with "Try It On" button
2. User taps "Try It On" button
3. Button disappears, loading state appears
4. Mannequin transforms into generated result (fade effect)
5. "Share" button appears in same position
6. User can tap "Share" to navigate to Share View

### Error Handling
- Network errors during try-on generation
- Invalid image processing
- Timeout scenarios
- Graceful fallbacks with retry options

### Performance
- Smooth animations at 60fps
- Fast loading of placeholder images
- Efficient memory usage for image handling
- Proper image optimization

## Development Requirements

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests

- Mobile interaction tests (touch events)
- Animation validation
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance benchmarks

#### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% test coverage for all new components
- All error scenarios covered
- All user interaction paths tested
- All accessibility features validated

### Quality Assurance
