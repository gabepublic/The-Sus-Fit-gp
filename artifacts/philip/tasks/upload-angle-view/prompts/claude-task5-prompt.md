**TASK: Complete Task 5 - Build PhotoFrame Component (All Subtasks)**

**CONTEXT**: You're working on an isolated UploadAngle feature following the UPLOAD_ANGLE_ISOLATION_STRATEGY.md. The PhotoFrame component is the main photo display component that will show upload states, animations, and accessibility features.

**OBJECTIVE**: Complete Task 5 and all its subtasks (5.1-5.5), then run comprehensive tests including Home View regression tests.

**TASK BREAKDOWN**:

**5.1** - PhotoFrame base structure with TypeScript interfaces and props
**5.2** - Four visual states: empty, uploading, loaded, error with ARIA attributes  
**5.3** - CSS-in-JS styling with 4:3 aspect ratio and responsive design
**5.4** - Touch interactions and Framer Motion animations
**5.5** - Accessibility features, error handling, keyboard navigation

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**:

1. **File Location**: `src/mobile/components/UploadAngle/components/PhotoFrame.tsx`
2. **Styling**: Use styled-components/emotion for CSS-in-JS isolation
3. **Aspect Ratio**: Fixed 4:3 using `aspect-ratio` CSS or padding-bottom technique
4. **States**: Empty (upload icon), uploading (spinner), loaded (image), error (retry)
5. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
6. **Animations**: Framer Motion for state transitions and touch feedback
7. **Touch**: React touch events with proper preventDefault
8. **TypeScript**: Strict typing with PhotoFrameProps interface

**DEPENDENCIES COMPLETED**: Tasks 1-4 (directory structure, types, utilities, hooks)

**VERIFICATION STEPS**:
1. Run `pnpm type-check` - must pass
2. Run `pnpm lint` - must pass  
3. Run all UploadAngle component tests
4. Run Home View regression tests to verify no impact

**DELIVERABLES**:
- Complete PhotoFrame.tsx component
- All 5 subtasks marked complete
- Tests passing for PhotoFrame functionality
- Home View regression tests confirming no side effects

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- Must be completely isolated from HomeView components
- Follow brutalist design system (will be styled later in Task 7)
- Performance-optimized with React.memo where appropriate
- No external dependencies beyond approved project stack

Start with subtask 5.1 and progress sequentially through 5.5. Update task status using appropriate commands as you complete each subtask.
