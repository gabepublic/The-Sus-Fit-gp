# Task ID: 3
# Title: Migrate Try-On Logic to React Query Mutation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract try-on functionality from page component into a React Query useMutation hook with comprehensive error handling
# Details:
Create useTryonMutation hook in business-layer/mutations/ that wraps the existing /api/tryon endpoint. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries, 1s, 2s, 4s delays). Add proper TypeScript typing for mutation variables and response. Include comprehensive error handling for validation, timeout, and API errors. Migrate image processing logic (resize, compression, validation) from page component.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for mutation behavior, error handling scenarios, retry mechanism testing, integration tests with mock API
