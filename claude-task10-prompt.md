- [ ] Set up Playwright for cross-browser E2E testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Install/configure jest-axe for accessibility testing
- [ ] Set up MSW for API mocking
- [ ] Configure coverage reporting targeting >95%
- [ ] Add testing scripts and CI integration
- [ ] Create test utilities and custom matchers

### 10.2: Unit/Component Tests
- [ ] Test useAngleUpload hook (state management, error handling)
- [ ] Test useImageProcessing hook (image compression, memory management)
- [ ] Test PhotoFrame component (all 4 states: empty, uploading, loaded, error)
- [ ] Test UploadButton/NextButton (states, interactions, accessibility)
- [ ] Test UploadAngleContainer (workflow orchestration, integration)
- [ ] Test utility functions (validation, compression, error handling)
- [ ] Achieve >95% code coverage for all UploadAngle components

### 10.3: E2E Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete upload workflow testing (file selection → preview → navigation)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design testing
- [ ] File validation and error scenarios
- [ ] Network failure and retry testing
- [ ] Performance under various network conditions
- [ ] Visual regression with screenshot comparisons

### 10.4: Performance Benchmarking  
- [ ] Bundle size analysis with webpack-bundle-analyzer
- [ ] Memory leak detection using Chrome DevTools
- [ ] Core Web Vitals testing (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] Image processing performance benchmarks
- [ ] Component rendering performance
- [ ] 60fps animation validation on mobile
- [ ] Lighthouse CI integration

### 10.5: Visual Regression & Accessibility
- [ ] Set up Storybook with component stories
- [ ] Chromatic integration for visual regression
- [ ] Automated accessibility testing (jest-axe, axe-playwright)
- [ ] Manual screen reader testing checklist
- [ ] Color contrast validation
- [ ] Keyboard navigation testing
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

## Critical Testing Focus Areas

### 1. Isolation Verification
- **Verify zero impact on HomeView:** Run HomeView tests after UploadAngle implementation
- **Dependency isolation:** Ensure no imports from HomeView components
- **Independent compilation:** Verify UploadAngle system compiles separately

### 2. Upload Workflow Testing
- **File validation:** Test supported formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP), size limits (10MB), dimensions (400x300 min)
- **Image processing:** Test compression, blob URL management, memory cleanup
- **State management:** Test all upload states and transitions
- **Error handling:** Test validation failures, network errors, recovery mechanisms

### 3. Accessibility Compliance
- **Screen reader compatibility:** Test with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Keyboard navigation:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **ARIA attributes:** Proper labels, roles, live regions
- **Color contrast:** Minimum 4.5:1 ratio compliance

### 4. Performance Requirements
- **Bundle size:** Monitor and prevent bloat
- **Memory management:** No leaks during upload operations  
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- **Mobile performance:** Smooth 60fps animations

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Infrastructure Setup (10.1)
```bash
# Install additional testing dependencies if needed
pnpm add -D @storybook/react @storybook/addon-essentials chromatic
pnpm add -D size-limit webpack-bundle-analyzer lighthouse-ci

# Configure test scripts in package.json (already exist)
# - pnpm test:upload-angle (isolated UploadAngle testing)  
# - pnpm test:e2e (Playwright E2E tests)
# - pnpm test:coverage (coverage reporting)
```

### Step 2: Test Development Approach
1. **Start with utilities:** Test imageValidation, uploadHelpers, constants
2. **Test hooks:** useAngleUpload, useImageProcessing with renderHook
3. **Test components:** PhotoFrame, buttons with user interactions
4. **Test integration:** UploadAngleContainer with complete workflows
5. **Add E2E tests:** Full user journeys with Playwright

### Step 3: Quality Gates
- **Type Safety:** `pnpm type-check` must pass
- **Linting:** `pnpm lint` must pass  
- **Test Coverage:** >95% for UploadAngle code
- **Accessibility:** Zero critical violations
- **Performance:** All benchmarks within thresholds

## Post-Completion Validation

### HomeView Regression Testing
After completing all UploadAngle testing, run comprehensive HomeView tests:
```bash
# Run existing HomeView-related tests
pnpm test -- --testPathPatterns="(?!.*UploadAngle).*" 
pnpm test:e2e -- --grep="HomeView|home"
pnpm type-check
pnpm lint
```

### Final Quality Checklist
- [ ] All 5 subtasks completed and verified
- [ ] >95% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Zero TypeScript/ESLint errors
- [ ] All E2E tests passing across browsers
- [ ] Accessibility audit shows zero critical issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable ranges
- [ ] HomeView functionality unaffected (regression tests passing)
- [ ] Bundle size analysis shows no significant bloat

## Success Criteria
1. **Complete test suite** covering all UploadAngle functionality
2. **>95% code coverage** for the UploadAngle component system
3. **Zero critical accessibility violations** 
4. **Full cross-browser compatibility** verified
5. **Performance benchmarks met** for mobile devices
6. **HomeView isolation confirmed** via regression testing
7. **All type checking and linting** passing without errors

## Token Optimization Notes
- Focus on implementing comprehensive tests rather than documentation
- Prioritize functional testing over extensive explanatory comments
- Use existing test patterns from the codebase where possible
- Leverage the robust testing infrastructure already in place
- Ensure efficient test execution and reliable CI integration

This task ensures the UploadAngle component system is production-ready with enterprise-grade quality assurance while maintaining complete isolation from existing HomeView functionality.
