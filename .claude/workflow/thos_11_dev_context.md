## Architecture Implementation

### Previous Architecture (Pre-THOS-11)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Monolithic Components       │
│  • Direct API calls in components   │
│  • Mixed UI and business logic      │
│  • Scattered React Query usage      │
│  • Complex state management         │
│  • Tight coupling between layers    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Problems with Old Architecture**:
- Image processing logic mixed with UI components
- React Query mutations directly in page components
- Error handling inconsistent across features
- Difficult to test business logic in isolation
- State synchronization issues between upload and try-on flows
- No orchestration layer for complex multi-step workflows

### New Three-Layer Architecture (THOS-11)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Presentation Layer           │
│    (UI Components, Pages, Layouts)  │
│  • Pure presentation components     │
│  • Consumes business layer hooks    │
│  • Minimal business logic           │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│         Business Layer              │
│  ┌─── Bridge Hooks ────────────┐    │
│  │ useBridgeLayer, useImageUpload │  │
│  │ • Orchestrate lower-level hooks│  │
│  │ • Simplify component APIs     │  │
│  │ • Handle complex workflows    │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌─── Core Business Logic ─────┐    │
│  │ Queries, Mutations, Services │    │
│  │ • React Query integration   │    │
│  │ • Business rules & validation│    │
│  │ • State management          │    │
│  └───────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────┐
│          Data Layer                 │
│    (API clients, External Services, │
│     Database interactions)          │
│  • HTTP requests to backend         │
│  • External API integrations        │
│  • Data fetching & caching          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## Development Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Initial Runtime Issues
**Problem**: Site wouldn't load locally, multiple Node.js process conflicts

**Symptoms**:
- Build errors and TypeScript compilation issues
- Development server failing to start
- Import/export resolution errors

**Solution**:
- Killed all Node processes: `pkill -f node`
- Clean restart of development environment
- ✅ **Result**: Site now loads and functions properly

### 2. Test Suite Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: Tests written for old architecture, not compatible with new layered approach

**Attempts Made**:

#### Approach A: Individual Test Fixing (❌ Failed - Inefficient)
- **Method**: Claude Code fixing 1-2 tests at a time
- **Results**: 117 → 102 failures (15 tests fixed)
- **Token Usage**: ~50,000+ tokens for minimal progress
- **Verdict**: Unsustainable, too resource-intensive

#### Approach B: Root Cause Analysis (🟡 Partial Success)
- **Method**: Deep dive into business logic for individual tests
- **Successes**:
    - Fixed React Query timing issues
    - Resolved image processing options merging
    - Fixed error handling in mutation callbacks
- **Issues**: Still one-by-one approach, limited scalability

#### Approach C: Systemic Pattern Analysis (🔄 Current)
- **Method**: Identify common failure patterns affecting multiple tests
- **Status**: Proposed but not yet implemented
- **Goal**: Find 3-5 systemic issues that could fix 15+ tests each

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked ✅
1. **Architecture Implementation**: TaskMaster AI successfully guided the 3-layer refactor with bridge hooks as part of business layer
2. **Site Functionality**: Core user experience maintained throughout refactor
3. **Bridge Hook Concept**: Orchestration hooks provide clean component APIs while keeping business logic organized
4. **Clean Restart Strategy**: Killing Node processes resolved runtime issues
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: When applied correctly, fixed real business logic bugs

### What Didn't Work ❌
1. **Individual Test Fixing**: Extremely token-intensive with minimal ROI
2. **Surface-Level Mock Fixes**: Addressed symptoms without solving root causes
3. **Estimation-Based Debugging**: Overestimated fix impact, underestimated complexity
4. **Scatter-Shot Approach**: Trying to fix multiple test categories simultaneously

### Key Insights 💡
1. **Runtime vs Tests**: Prioritize user-facing functionality over test perfection
2. **Systemic vs Individual**: Infrastructure problems require infrastructure solutions
3. **Token Economics**: Individual test debugging is unsustainable at scale
4. **Clean State**: Fresh starts can reveal masked underlying issues
5. **Bridge Pattern**: Orchestration hooks are essential but belong within business layer, not as separate layer

---

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Systemic Analysis**: Use Claude Code to identify top 3 failure patterns affecting 15+ tests each
2. **Infrastructure Focus**: Fix test setup/configuration issues that cascade to multiple tests
3. **Environment Standardization**: Ensure test environment matches runtime environment

### Medium-Term Goals
1. **Test Architecture Alignment**: Update test utilities to match new layered architecture
2. **Mock Strategy**: Implement consistent mocking strategy across all layers
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure tests pass in automated environments

### Long-Term Vision
1. **Test Coverage Goals**: Achieve 90%+ test pass rate
2. **Developer Experience**: Fast, reliable test feedback loop
3. **Quality Gates**: Automated testing blocking deployments

## Resources & Context

### Key Files
- **Business Layer**: `/src/business-layer/index.ts` (main exports)
- **Bridge Hooks**: `/src/business-layer/hooks/useBridgeLayer.ts` (main orchestration)
- **Core Business Logic**: `/src/business-layer/queries/`, `/src/business-layer/mutations/`
- **Test Configuration**: `/jest.config.js`, `/jest.setup.js`
- **Test Utilities**: `/__tests__/test-utils/`

### Previous Attempts Log
- **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)**: Test setup hooks, business layer exports (128→113 failures)
- **Phase 2 (Business Logic)**: Console log format alignment (113→110 failures)
- **Phase 3 (Direct Fixes)**: Specific test assertion updates (110 failures - minimal impact)
- **Legacy Individual Attempts**: Export fixes, fetch mocking, React Query timing (~15 total tests fixed)

### Current Blockers (CRITICAL INSIGHT)
1. **Mock Architecture Mismatch**: Tests mock old monolithic components, not new business layer
2. **Business Layer Mock Strategy**: Need to mock bridge hooks + core business logic properly
3. **React Query Provider Setup**: Test utilities don't provide proper QueryClient for business layer
4. **Component-Business Layer Integration**: Tests expect direct business logic access, not bridge layer orchestration
5. **Image Processing Mock Gaps**: Business layer image processing not properly mocked in tests

---

## Decision Points

### Continue Testing vs Move Forward?
**Option A**: Fix remaining 128 test failures before new development  
**Option B**: Accept current 83% pass rate, focus on new features  
**Option C**: Implement systematic test fixing approach with better ROI

### Recommended Approach
**Hybrid Strategy**:
1. Fix critical systematic issues (target 95% pass rate)
2. Accept remaining edge cases for now
3. Fix tests incrementally as features are developed
4. Prevent new test failures through better practices
