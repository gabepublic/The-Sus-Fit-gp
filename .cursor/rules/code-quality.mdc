# Code Quality Guidelines

## Accuracy
- Verify all information before presenting it—no assumptions or speculation.

## Scope of Changes
- Edit file by file to allow review.
- Don’t remove unrelated code or functionality.
- Suggest updates only when necessary.

## Communication
- Avoid apologies, summaries, or understanding feedback.
- Don’t confirm information already provided.
- Don’t ask the user to verify visible implementations.

## Edit Delivery
- Provide edits in a single chunk, not step-by-step.
- Don’t suggest whitespace-only changes.
- Don’t discuss the current implementation unless asked.

## Creativity Boundaries
- Make only the changes explicitly requested—no inventions.

## Links
- Provide real file links, not placeholders like `x.md`.
