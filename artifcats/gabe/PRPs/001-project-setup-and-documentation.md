## Changes
- Added `CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive development guidelines
- Created PRP template structure in `PRPs/templates/`
- Set up Claude Code configuration in `.claude/`
- Established coding standards for Next.js/React/TypeScript project

## Files Added
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project development guidelines and AI behavior rules
- `PRPs/templates/prp_base.md` - Template for future PRPs
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code local settings
- `.claude/commands/generate-prp.md` - Command for generating PRPs
- `.claude/commands/execute-prp.md` - Command for executing PRPs

## Technical Details
The `CLAUDE.md` file establishes:
- Project awareness and context requirements
- Code structure and modularity standards
- Testing and reliability requirements
- Task completion validation steps
- Style and convention guidelines
- AI behavior rules for consistent development

## Testing
- No tests required for documentation files
- Guidelines will be validated through future development work

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Documentation and configuration files only
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Establishes foundation for consistent development practices

## Rollback Plan
- Remove added files if needed
- No dependencies or integrations to reverse
