# Overview 
We are starting with a blank-canvas, web-based application that will evolve incrementally into a full-featured product usable on both desktop and mobile platforms.

# Core Features  
1. **Responsive Web Application**
   - **Purpose**: Enables access via any modern browser on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
   - **Value**: Maximizes accessibility and usability—no installation required.
   - **Implementation**: Uses responsive web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript frameworks) to adapt layout dynamically across screen sizes.

2. **Minimal Single-Page Experience**
   - **Purpose**: Centralizes user interactions in a single page.
   - **Value**: Reduces friction and improves UI performance.
   - **Implementation**: Single HTML shell with dynamic content and routing managed by client-side logic (i.e., Next.js).

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**: Will be defined incrementally alongside feature development.

- **Key User Flows**: Introduced progressively with each new feature.

- **UI/UX Considerations**:
  - Clean, intuitive design
  - Mobile-first layout with generously sized buttons and controls optimized for finger input.
  - Lightweight and performance-optimized

# Technical Architecture  

## Application Framework
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Version:** 15+
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.0+
- **Build Tool:** Next.js's integrated build system

### Import Strategy
- **Strategy:** Node.js modules
- **Package Manager:** npm or pnpm
- **Node Version:** 22 LTS

## Database
- None

## Code Repository
- Git repository has been initialized
- ✅ Note: Verify initial setup, access permissions, .gitignore, and branch strategy

## Frontend Stack
- Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Next.js
- ✅ Note: The Next.js SPA scaffold has already been created using `npx create-next-app@latest; need review for structure, routing, and folder conventions

### CSS Framework
- **Framework:** TailwindCSS
- **Version:** ^4
- **PostCSS:** Yes

### UI Components
- **Library:** shadcn/ui
- **Version:** Latest
- **Installation:** via npm

## Assets & Media

### Fonts
- **Provider:** Google Fonts
- **Primary:** Inter (modern, readable)
- **Secondary:** Poppins (creative elements)
- **Loading Strategy:** Self-hosted for performance

### Icons
- **Library:** Lucide React
- **Implementation:** React components
- **Custom Icons:** SVG-based for brand elements

## Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Trigger:** Push to main branch
- **Tests:** Jest + React Testing Library
- **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier
- ✅ Note: Deployment pipeline setup is NOT required — hosting provider will pull directly from GitHub

### Environments
- **Production:** main branch → Vercel
- **Staging:** develop branch → Vercel Preview
- **Development:** Local development server


# Development Roadmap  
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**:
  - Responsive SPA with single-page architecture

- **Planned Enhancements**:
  - Incremental addition of features to evolve the application into a full-featured product
  - Each enhancement will be prioritized based on user value, technical feasibility, and alignment with the overall product vision

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. ✅ Confirm Git repo setup and Next.js scaffold readiness
2. Set up basic SPA routing and layout
3. Implement responsive UI shell and minimal interaction loop
4. Incrementally layer features with corresponding tasks and components

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - *Risk*: Inconsistent camera support across browsers.
  - *Mitigation*: Use polyfills and test across major browsers early.

- **Limited Functionality in MVP**:
  - *Risk*: Users may perceive limited functionality
  - *Mitigation*: Emphasize minimalism, privacy-first design, and incremental roadmap for future features

# Appendix  
- **Research Findings**:
  - Prioritize common baseline functionality to reduce dev time and improve user experience
  - Add commonly needed functionalities to baseline to reduce development time.
